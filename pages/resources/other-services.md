- [Advanced Computing Research
  Centre](http://www.bris.ac.uk/acrc/contact/): The Research Software
  Engineering (RSE) team at the ACRC offer advice and support through their
  ask-RSE service. They also deliver [training courses](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/acrc/acrc-training/) on python,
  software best practice and version control (among other things). It
  is also worth noting that RSEs can be contracted to conduct project
  work with UoB researchers, provided the funding covers a minimum of
  0.5 FTE for 6 months.</br>

- [Research IT](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/research-it/about): Provide
  support to UoB researchers in the writing of the technical aspects
  of bid applications and identifying ways software can realise their
  research goals. Can provide help with software or programming to
  support research on a consultancy basis. Research IT can be
  contracted to consult on projects for shorter durations than the
  ACRC RSEs (i.e. at a day rate).</br>

Other resources are available for help with data science related queries at the 
Univeristy of Bristol.
- For help with coding or data intensive projects that may need advanced computational
  or storage resources the [Advanced Computing Research
  Centre](http://www.bris.ac.uk/acrc/contact/) deliver training courses in coding, 
  high performance computing and data storage. They can also be contracted to help 
  with longer term projects.
- For help writing the more technical aspects of grant proposals, as well as
  ongoing help with short-term projects, [Research IT](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/research-it/about) 
  are a useful resource.
- For help with research data management, literature search and literacture reviews
  using advanced search tools, [Library Research
  Support](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/library/research-support/) is also available.
- If you have an idea for an interdisciplinary research project and would like
  funding to support a pilot, the JGI is happy to accept applications for seedcorn funding.
