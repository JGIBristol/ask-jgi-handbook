# Time allocation for queries
Although Ask-JGI team members have up to one day to spend on Ask-JGI
queries, it is expected that most queries should take half a day or
less.  If you have a query that you think might take longer then this
can be discussed with the Ask-JGI shift coordinator.

```{tip}
Remember that the
Ask-JGI slack channel is there for you to ask for help and to discuss
your queries. 
```

Shifters are responsible for recording honestly the time that is spent
on each Ask-JGI query. This time can include time spent preparing for
and participating in meetings with Ask-JGI "customers," as well as any
time spent researching the query and preparing email responses. 

Once a query has been resolved the Ask-JGI team member should note the
number of hours spent on the query on the tracker ticket.
