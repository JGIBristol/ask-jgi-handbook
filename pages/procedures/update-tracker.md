## Filling out the tracker

This section outlines the procedure that should be followed any time
a new Ask-JGI query is received, and when any further action is taken
thereafter. This other action could be a response to the query, a
follow up email from the querier, or following up from a meeting.

When a new Ask-JGI query is received and an automatic reply is sent,
a new ticket is opened on the Ask-JGI tracker. This will look
something like the entry below:

:::

Some of the information is automatically filled out, as shown in the
image above. The **Who** field is updated with the email address of
the query sender, the **Query** field is filled with the email title,
and the date of the query (**Date opened**) and the last time the
query was updated (**Date updated** -- the date of the latest email in
the thread associated with that query) are set. 

1.  Open the ticket by clicking on the title under the **Query** field
    heading. You will see the automatically set **Who**, **Query**, and
    dates fields:

2.  If the title of the email is obscure or could be made more concise,
    change the **Query** field to something more meaningful and easy to
    understand.
    Similarly, update the **Author** field if the query was forwarded from
    someone different to the person asking the query.

3.  The **Status** field is automatically set to "New" for newly
    opened tickets. Once you have started work on your query, this
    status should be changed to "In progress."

4.  The **Query topic** field describes the broad topic which the
    query covers. This field is a set of tags so pick as many options
    as are relevant to this query. If you find that the topic isn't
    adequately described by any of the available tags, you can add a
    new one on the main tracker page:
    click **Faculty** > **Column settings** > **Edit**, and add new
    choices to the list. Please take care not to duplicate entries (e.g.
    _Natural language processing_ and _NLP_ would show up as different
    options, which is inconvenient for analytics and reporting later on).

5.  The **Task for Ask-JGI** field is another collection of tags
    describing the work which is required of the person assigned to the
    task. New options can also be added from the main tracker page.

:::

6.  Add your name / email address under the **Assigned to**
    field. There is also an **Assigned to 2** field. This can be used
    e.g. if you are working jointly on a query with another team
    member. Otherwise it can be left blank.

7.  Record the number of hours spent on a given task in the **Time taken**
    field. This includes time taken to respond to emails, setting up and
    attending meetings with service users, and investigating the question
    itself (be it reviewing code, data, research, etc.). This is used to
    work out internally how long is spent on each type of query, so it is
    useful to keep it updated to at least the amount of hours spent.
    For example if two Ask-JGIers attend a half-hour meeting, this should
    be recorded as 1hr rather than 0.5hrs. If you think a query is going to
    take more than 5 hours of your time, discuss this with your data science
    supervisor.
    
8.  The **Notes** field should be used to make any notes/supplementary
    details on the status of the query. Typically a broad summary of
    actions taken during work on the query should be recorded.

:::

9.  Select the Faculty that the person who submitted the query is
    associated with. This may require some Google searching if the
    information is not included in their email. Note that there is a drop
    down list for this, but new options can be added from the main tracker
    page.

:::

10. Select the School that the person who submitted the query is
    associated with. Note that there is the option to select "External"
    for contacts from outside the University of Bristol.

12. Finally, fill in the **Roadshow** field to determine whether the query
    originated from the Ask-JGI roadshow.
