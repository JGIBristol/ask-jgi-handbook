## Storing files and data

This section gives advice on where you can store files or data relating to an Ask-JGI query.

We reccommend that, where possible, code and data are shared openly. This could be on a public GitHub repository, either under the [Jean Golding Institute](https://github.com/Jean-Golding-Institute) GitHub organisation, or on your own account. When a project is shared publicly, we ask that the README file or front page contains the attribution "Supported by the [Jean Golding Institute](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/golding/)'s Ask-JGI service".

```{warning}
If your project is working with sensitive data or code, check with the person that raised the query where the best place to store things is, and whether it is appropriate to share things publicly.
```

If it is not approriate to share things publicly, then you should store files and data in a secure place. One such place is the [Projects folder on the Ask-JGI SharePoint](https://uob.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/teams/grp-jeangoldinginstituteteam/Shared%20Documents/Ask-JGI/SHARED/Projects?csf=1&web=1&e=PteIIp).
