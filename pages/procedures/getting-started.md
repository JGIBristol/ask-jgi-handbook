# Getting started

If you are a new recruit looking to get set up for working with
Ask-JGI, welcome to the team! 

This handbook is meant to serve as a guide to explain how Ask-JGI
works and what is expected of you as an Ask-JGI shifter. Please take
the time to read through the procedures chapter in this handbook to
make sure that you are up to speed on your responsibilities.

Before you begin your first Ask-JGI shift you will need to make sure
that you are able to access some platforms, pages and groups. Please
see the sections below for instructions on how to get yourself ready
for your first shift.

## Communicating on Teams

The platform that the Ask-JGI team uses to stay in touch on a
day-to-day basis is Microsoft Teams. The Jean Golding Institute uses
Teams to stay in touch with other team members, and to share ideas, events and
opportunities with each other.
There is a Teams channel specifically for the Ask-JGI team&mdash; you will be given access by a member of JGI staff.

The Teams channel is also used for the weekly Ask-JGI meetings.

## Getting set up with SharePoint

When you are added to the Ask-JGI Teams channel, you should be automatically granted access to the
Ask-JGI SharePoint folder, which can be found [here](https://uob.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/teams/grp-jeangoldinginstituteteam/Shared%20Documents/Ask-JGI?csf=1&web=1&e=imr5IE).
In this folder you will be able to store files related to any of your queries, such as meeting notes or code examples.

While working with Ask-JGI you will be expected to
attend weekly catch-up meetings with the rest of the team. 
The Ask-JGI weekly meetings are managed through the Teams channel.

Login using your UoB account.

## Ask-JGI mailbox access

A major part of your duties while undertaking shifts for Ask-JGI will
be to monitor the Ask-JGI mailbox. 

Before beginning your first shift
you must make sure that you are able to access the mailbox
[here](https://outlook.office.com/mail/ask-jgi@bristol.ac.uk/inbox).
Contact the Ask-JGI coordinator in case of problems and they should be
able to grant you access.

## Ask-JGI tracker access

Any new query that is submitted to Ask-JGI results in a ticket being
opened on the [Ask-JGI tracker](filler).

Before beginning your first shift
you must make sure that you are able to access the tracker
[here](https://uob.sharepoint.com/teams/grp-jeangoldinginstituteteam/Lists/AskJGI%20tracker).
Contact the Ask-JGI coordinator in case of problems and they should be
able to grant you access.


## FAQs: 

__Q1: Are we on the Demonstrator rate or Graduate Teacher Level 1?__\
__A__: Demonstrator rate

__Q2: Is each payslip for the hours worked in that month e.g. April payslip is hours worked in April?__\
__A__: April’s payslip should contain the hours worked in March**

__Q3: Is the "* N" bit in the payments section of the payslip indicating the hours that were submitted for that month?__\
__A__: Yes (but as above, it’s the number for the previous month and there should only be a discrepancy if you updated your Google sheet late or something (but that wouldn’t be a big deal because the missed hours would just carry over onto your next payslip))

__Q4: Did other people switch from "Casual Fee per Hour (Operational)" to "Casual Fee per Hour (Technical)" from April to May? Does this mean anything?__\
__A__: The normal Ask-JGI stuff should always say “(Operational)” as far as I’m aware - it sounds like your “(Technical)” pay was for other work
