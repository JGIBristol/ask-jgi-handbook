# Ask-JGI Student Recruitment

This section outlines the procedure for advertising and recruiting 
new Ask-JGI student cohorts. 

Recruitment takes place annually (new cohort starting in October), 
but we are happy to receive speculative applications all year round.

The recruitment call from the previous year is available on the JGI
webpage [here](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/golding/ask-jgi/ask-jgi-phd-recruitment/)
(hidden from the main website).

Ask-JGI aims to recruit **students undertaking a PhD at the University
of Bristol** in a technical domain, where they are developing skills
that can be used to advise others across the university with their own
technical tasks in the areas of statistics and data science.

## Cohort recruitment timeline

- July 1st: Draft advertisement webpage, with links to previous Ask-JGI
  student blogs
- July 20th: Release advertisement
- August 30th: Deadline for applications
- September 5th: Email successful applicants and set up TSS contracts
  (3 week turnaround)
- October 1st: Start date.


## Recruitment criteria

The prerequisites for recruitment are as follows:

- Students must be currently studying for a PhD at the University of
  Bristol
- Students must have completed at least one year of their PhD studies
  by the time of their application
- Students must have experience in data science, statistics and
  programming (R, Python)

_This should be updated for future rounds._


## Advertising

This opportunity should be circulated in the JGI Newsletter and on the
Bristol Data Science Network Slack workspace.

Current Ask-JGI students should also be asked to circulate the
opportunity to their peers.

The Ask-JGI Manager should reach out directly to the Bristol leads for
the following doctoral training centres at the University of Bristol,
and ask that they circulate this opportunity amongst their CDT cohorts
and also within their faculties to ask other PhD supervisors to make
their students aware of this:
