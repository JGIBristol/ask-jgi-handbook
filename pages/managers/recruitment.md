# Ask-JGI Student Recruitment

This section outlines the (suggested) procedure for advertising and
recruiting new Ask-JGI student cohorts. 

Ask-JGI aims to recruit **students undertaking a PhD at the University
of Bristol** in a technical domain, where they are developing skills
that can be used to advise others across the university with their own
technical tasks in the areas of statistics and data science.

## Cohort recruitment timeline

- July 1st: Draft advertisement webpage, with links to previous Ask-JGI
  student blogs
- July 20th: Release advertisement
- August 30th: Deadline for applications
- September 5th: Email successful applicants and set up TSS contracts
  (3 week turnaround)
- October 1st: Start date.


## Recruitment criteria

The webpage used in the initial round of Ask-JGI student recruitment
can be found here:

https://www.bristol.ac.uk/golding/ask-jgi/ask-jgi-phd-recruitment/

This should be updated for future rounds. 

The requirements for these posts are as follows:
- Students must be currently studying for a PhD at the University of
  Bristol
- Students must have completed at least one year of their PhD studies
  by the time of their application
- Students must have experience in data science, statistics and
  programming


## Advertising

This opportunity should be circulated in the JGI Newsletter and on the
Bristol Data Science Network Slack workspace.

The Ask-JGI Manager should reach out directly to the Bristol leads for
the following doctoral training centres at the University of Bristol,
and ask that they circulate this opportunity amongst their CDT cohorts
and also within their faculties to ask other PhD supervisors to make
their students aware of this:
