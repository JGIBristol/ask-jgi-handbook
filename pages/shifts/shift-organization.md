# Shift organization

Ask-JGI shifts will be undertaken by Ask-JGI team members in 2 week blocks.
There tends to be one Ask-JGI team member on shift at any one time, but in the past when there have been lots of queries, there have been 2 people on shift at once.

To sign up for a shift, you can add your name to one of the 'Open Shift'
calendar events in the
[mailbox](https://outlook.office.com/mail/ask-jgi@bristol.ac.uk/inbox/).

For each 2 week shift block a base salary of 2 hours will be paid at a demonstrator hourly rate. 
This is to cover the monitoring of the Ask-JGI mailbox/slack channel and attendance at the weekly Ask-JGI [data science meetings](meetings).

The number of queries each week can be quite variable (sometimes none, but sometimes 10!). 
We expect that the person on shift handles 1-2 queries, and that the rest of the queries are handed around to other Ask-JGI team members. 
For each query, up to one day of support is freely available to University of Bristol staff and PhD students in all faculties and departments. 
When a query is picked up, Ask-JGI team members should report the number of hours spent addressing that query, and they will be paid for their consultation at the hourly demonstrator rate.
