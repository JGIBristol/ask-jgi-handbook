# Shifter tasks

Although sometimes there may only be one person on shift at a time,
the hope is that (in the beginning at least) there will be two people
on shift at any one time (as indicated in the [shift block
diagram](diagram)). 

The following tasks are expected of Ask-JGI team members while they
are on shift:

1. Each shift block begins on a Monday. Each Monday drop a note in
the Ask-JGI slack channel to say good morning. This is to check-in
with the JGI data scientists and the other person currently on shift. </br></br>

2. If there are two of you on shift, then check-in with your new shift
buddy on the first day of your (or their) shift, which will be a
Monday. If it is your first day (week 1 of your shift block), then your buddy should be able to
fill you in with any news from the previous week. If it is your second
week on shift then you should be able to provide this information to
your new buddy. </br></br>
3. You are expected to monitor the [Ask-JGI
  mailbox](https://outlook.office.com/mail/ask-jgi@bristol.ac.uk/inbox) every day, checking
   for any new queries or any follow-up emails from past weeks.
   </br></br>
4. You are expected to monitor the Ask-JGI slack channel
   throughout the day in case of any important messages. This is also
   where you can post any new queries that you would like input on, or
   that you would like to offer up to other Ask-JGI team members to
   participate in.
   ```{tip}
   Remember that the JGI data scientists are on the slack channel too,
   and they can offer advice and pointers on any query that you need help
   with.
   ```
   </br>
5. Ask-JGI team members are expected to attend the weekly Ask-JGI
[data science meetings](meetings) while they are on shift to report on
the status of the mailbox and any ongoing queries.
</br></br>
6. For any query that you pick up, you are responsible for filling out
   the [Ask-JGI
   tracker](https://uob.sharepoint.com/teams/grp-jeangoldinginstituteteam/Lists/AskJGI%20tracker/) 
   as per the instructions [here](filler). It is
   important to keep this up to date to reflect the status of all
   mailbox queries.
